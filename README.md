# Mental Health in the Tech Industry - README

## Introduction
This analysis explores the intersection of mental health and the Tech Industry using a comprehensive dataset. Key insights include:

## Demographics
- The dataset reflects diverse respondents, predominantly young adults (31-45), mostly males, with a substantial presence from the USA.

## Chronological Trends
- 2016 saw the highest participation, but 2015 data is absent. Fluctuations in "AnswerText" distribution hint at non-mandatory or lengthy questions influencing responses.

## Question Answer Patterns
- While all answered questions 1-12, a decline in responses suggests participant hesitation or survey fatigue. Gaps in question numbering hint at potential deleted or lost questions.

## Identified Focus Questions
- Questions 5, 6, and 7 are chosen for in-depth analysis, exploring correlations between mental health, work conditions, and their impact on respondents.

## Preliminary Analysis Conclusion
- The data suggests a connection between mental health and work. Being self-employed doesn't necessarily mean working in tech. Seeking mental health help (Q7) can affect job performance, and a family history of mental health issues (Q6) is linked to facing similar challenges (Q12) at work. This underscores the interconnectedness of mental health, family history, and work, emphasizing the need for supportive workplaces.
